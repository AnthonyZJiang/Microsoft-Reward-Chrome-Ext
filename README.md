# Microsoft-Reward-Chrome-Ext
A Chrome extension for getting MS Rewards points automatically. 

It does two things in background every 30 minutes:

1. Completing PC and mobile search quests, if they are not completed.
2. Trying to complete quiz and promotion quests, if thery are not completed. If the quests fail, it will notify user by sending Chrome notifications and changing the colour of the Action Button to red. The unacquired points will be shown in the badge.

This is my first try on making an extension for Chrome. 

**Disclaimer**: This project only serves the purpose of learning extension development for Chrome. One shall not use this project for any activities outside this purpose.
